# Init Player Instruction

The `init_player` instruction creates a new player account with an initial health of 100.

First, we define the constant `MAX_HEALTH` as 100, representing the starting health value:

```rust
const MAX_HEALTH: u8 = 100;
```

Then, we define the `PlayerData` struct, which stores the player's health:

```rust
#[account]
pub struct PlayerData {
    pub health: u8,
}
```

The `init_player` instruction requires the following accounts:

- `player_data` - the new player account we are initializing, which will store the player's health
- `player` - the user who signs the transaction and pays for the initialization of the account
- `system_program` - a required account when creating a new account

The `player_data` account is initialized using a Program Derived Address (PDA) with the `player` public key as one of the seeds. This ensures that each `player_data` account is unique and associated with the `player`, allowing every player to create their own `player_data` account.

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct InitPlayer<'info> {
    #[account(
        init,
        payer = player,
        space = 8 + 8,
        seeds = [b"player", player.key().as_ref()],
        bump,
    )]
    pub player_data: Account<'info, PlayerData>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub player: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

The `init_player` instruction logic then sets the `health` field of the newly created player data account:

```rust
// Create new player account
pub fn init_player(ctx: Context<InitPlayer>) -> Result<()> {
    ctx.accounts.player_data.health = MAX_HEALTH;
    Ok(())
}
```
