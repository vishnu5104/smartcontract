# Making a game! üìù

Hey!

In this tutorial you will learn how you can use Solana to create a game using Anchor and Javascript.

For doing that, we will create a PDA which saves the current state of the game and the player position on chain.
We start at position 0 and will go on from there using commands move right and move left.

(In the second example we will add the functionality to reward the player that reaches the end.)

This tutorial is pretty simple, but will be essential in order to get a better understanding of how Solana works.

In later tutorials you will also learn how to connect to this program from within Unity game engine.
