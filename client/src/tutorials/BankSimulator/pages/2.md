# Initializing Bank Account

## Context

Scroll down to line 147 and see this:

```rs
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(thread_id: Vec<u8>)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub holder: Signer<'info>,

    #[account(
        init,
        payer = holder,
        seeds = [BANK_ACCOUNT_SEED, thread_id.as_ref()],
        bump,
        space = 8 + std::mem::size_of::<BankAccount>(),
    )]
    pub bank_account: Account<'info, BankAccount>,

    #[account(mut, address = Thread::pubkey(thread_authority.key(), thread_id))]
    pub thread: SystemAccount<'info>,

    #[account(seeds = [THREAD_AUTHORITY_SEED], bump)]
    pub thread_authority: SystemAccount<'info>,

    #[account(address = clockwork_sdk::ID)]
    pub clockwork_program: Program<'info, clockwork_sdk::ThreadProgram>,

    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

We have first defined our `bank_account`, which is derived using our bank account seed constant and a thread id.
The thread id here is the automation thread by Clockwork whose Id we're passing.

Next, have our `thread` account and the thread account's `thread_authority`, these are also mandatory accounts for our threads to work for automation.

At the bottom, we also need to pass Clockwork program for this to work. Hence, we're using `clockwork_program` account as well.

## Instruction

This is the most important part of our program, let's have a look at line 21:

```rs
pub fn initialize_account(
    ctx: Context<Initialize>,
    thread_id: Vec<u8>,
    holder_name: String,
    balance: f64,
) -> Result<()> {
    // Other code

    // Clockwork Target Instruction
    let target_ix = Instruction {
        program_id: ID,
        accounts: crate::accounts::AddInterest {
            bank_account: bank_account.key(),
            thread: thread.key(),
            thread_authority: thread_authority.key(),
        }
        .to_account_metas(Some(true)),
        data: crate::instruction::AddInterest {
            _thread_id: thread_id.clone(),
        }
        .data(),
    };

    // Clockwork Trigger
    let trigger = clockwork_sdk::state::Trigger::Cron {
        schedule: CRON_SCHEDULE.to_string(),
        skippable: true,
    };

    // Clockwork thread CPI
    let bump = ctx.bumps.thread_authority;
    clockwork_sdk::cpi::thread_create(
        CpiContext::new_with_signer(
            clockwork_program.to_account_info(),
            clockwork_sdk::cpi::ThreadCreate {
                payer: holder.to_account_info(),
                system_program: system_program.to_account_info(),
                thread: thread.to_account_info(),
                authority: thread_authority.to_account_info(),
            },
            &[&[THREAD_AUTHORITY_SEED, &[bump]]],
        ),
        AUTOMATION_FEE as u64 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
        thread_id,
        vec![target_ix.into()],
        trigger,
    )?;

    Ok(())
}
```

This instruction takes in the unique `thread_id`, account `holder_name` and the initial deposit amount as the `balance` parameter.

The important part is how our automation is defined and triggered. We need three things for Clockwork automation to work:

1. Target Instruction
2. Automation Trigger
3. CPI to Thread

We're targeting the `add_interest` instruction, and it's context `AddInterest` for our automation, we'll learn about them in detail later.

Then, we've defined our trigger, which is a simple cron job for us. It's using the `CRON_SCHEDULE` constant we defined earlier.

Finally, we're making a CPI to clockwork thread, starting at line 63.

Let's see how depositing and withdrawing balance works.
