# Adding Interest

We're using simple compound interest formula in our program to add interest.
Check line 106:

```rs
pub fn add_interest(ctx: Context<AddInterest>, _thread_id: Vec<u8>) -> Result<()> {
    let now = Clock::get().unwrap().unix_timestamp;

    let bank_account = &mut ctx.accounts.bank_account;
    bank_account.updated_at = now;

    let elapsed_time = (now - bank_account.created_at) as f64;
    let minutes = elapsed_time / 60.0;
    let accumulated_value = bank_account.balance * (1.0 + (MINUTE_INTEREST)).powf(minutes);
    bank_account.balance = accumulated_value;

    msg!(
        "New Balance: {}, Minutes Elasped when Called: {}",
        accumulated_value,
        minutes,
    );
    Ok(())
}
```

Our `add_interest` instruction simply accepts a thread id, which is used in the context to derive our bank account.

We're essentially getting the time at which this instruction is called, subtracting it with bank's creation time to get time elapsed, and then using compound interest formula to get our final `accumulated_value` and setting it to user's balance. We're also logging this using `msg` macro for debugging purposes.

Our AddInterest context is also fairly simple:

```rs
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(thread_id: Vec<u8>)]
pub struct AddInterest<'info> {
    #[account(mut, seeds = [BANK_ACCOUNT_SEED, thread_id.as_ref()], bump)]
    pub bank_account: Account<'info, BankAccount>,

    #[account(signer, constraint = thread.authority.eq(&thread_authority.key()))]
    pub thread: Account<'info, Thread>,

    #[account(seeds = [THREAD_AUTHORITY_SEED], bump)]
    pub thread_authority: SystemAccount<'info>,
}
```

We're just getting bank account, thread address and thread authority for clockwork program to call this instruction as target for their automation.

Finally, let's see how we can close our bank account
