# Depositing

Our deposit instruction is fairly simple, navigate to line 84:

```rs
pub fn deposit(ctx: Context<UpdateBalance>, _thread_id: Vec<u8>, amount: f64) -> Result<()> {
    if amount < 0.0 {
        return Err(error!(ErrorCode::AmountTooSmall));
    };

    let bank_account = &mut ctx.accounts.bank_account;
    bank_account.balance += amount;
    Ok(())
}
```

We're simply taking in the `thread_id`, that is being used in our `UpdateBalance` context as seed to derive our bank account and adding a balance.

We're first making sure deposit balance amount is not in negative using the if condition.

Scroll all the way to bottom and reach line 235 to see our error codes:

```rs
#[error_code]
pub enum ErrorCode {
    #[msg("Amount must be greater than zero")]
    AmountTooSmall,

    #[msg("Withdraw amount cannot be less than deposit")]
    AmountTooBig,
}
```

# Withdrawing

Withdrawing is almost identical to depositing, check line 95:

```rs
pub fn withdraw(ctx: Context<UpdateBalance>, _thread_id: Vec<u8>, amount: f64) -> Result<()> {
    let bank_account = &mut ctx.accounts.bank_account;

    if amount > bank_account.balance {
        return Err(error!(ErrorCode::AmountTooBig));
    };

    bank_account.balance -= amount;
    Ok(())
}
```

Instead of adding amount, we're subtracting the amount here. Before that, we're making sure that the withdraw amount is not greater than our current balance.

Next, let's see how interest is being calculated and added to our balance.
