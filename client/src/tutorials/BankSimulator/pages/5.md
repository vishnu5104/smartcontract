# Closing Account

Scroll to line 200:

```rs
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(thread_id : Vec<u8>)]
pub struct RemoveAccount<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub holder: Signer<'info>,

    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [BANK_ACCOUNT_SEED, thread_id.as_ref()],
        bump,
        close = holder
    )]
    pub bank_account: Account<'info, BankAccount>,

    #[account(mut, address = thread.pubkey(), constraint = thread.authority.eq(&thread_authority.key()))]
    pub thread: Account<'info, Thread>,

    #[account(seeds = [THREAD_AUTHORITY_SEED], bump)]
    pub thread_authority: SystemAccount<'info>,

    #[account(address = clockwork_sdk::ID)]
    pub clockwork_program: Program<'info, clockwork_sdk::ThreadProgram>,
}
```

In our `RemoveAccount` context, we're closing our bank account, as well as passing `thread`, `thread_authority` and `clockwork_program` so that clockwork can also close it's thread. Open the instruction in line 125 to understand this:

```rs
pub fn remove_account(ctx: Context<RemoveAccount>, _thread_id: Vec<u8>) -> Result<()> {
    // Accounts
    let clockwork_program = &ctx.accounts.clockwork_program;
    let holder = &ctx.accounts.holder;
    let thread = &ctx.accounts.thread;
    let thread_authority = &ctx.accounts.thread_authority;

    // Delete thread via CPI
    let bump = ctx.bumps.thread_authority;
    clockwork_sdk::cpi::thread_delete(CpiContext::new_with_signer(
        clockwork_program.to_account_info(),
        clockwork_sdk::cpi::ThreadDelete {
            authority: thread_authority.to_account_info(),
            close_to: holder.to_account_info(),
            thread: thread.to_account_info(),
        },
        &[&[THREAD_AUTHORITY_SEED, &[bump]]],
    ))?;
    Ok(())
}
```

In this instruction, we're making a CPI using Clockwork's SDK to delete the automation thread that is running for our bank account to add interest.

And that is it! You just learned how to use Clockwork for on-chain automation by building a bank simulator application!
