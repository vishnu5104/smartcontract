# Defining Automation Constants

In the first few lines, we're defining some really important constants. Let's have a look.

```rust
// Line 10

const MINUTE_INTEREST: f64 = 0.05; // 5% interest return
const CRON_SCHEDULE: &str = "*/10 * * * * * *"; // 10s https://crontab.guru/
const AUTOMATION_FEE: f64 = 0.05; // https://docs.clockwork.xyz/developers/threads/fees

```

We first have `MINUTE_INTEREST`. In our program, we'll be giving 5% returns every minute. You can change it according to your needs, this is fairly simple.

Next, we have `CRON_SCHEDULE` constant defined. This format may look confusing, so in order to create your own schedule time, you can use [CronTab Tool](https://crontab.guru/). We'll get our Cronjob running every 10 seconds in our current program.

Then, we have our `AUTOMATION_FEE`, this is the fee we can deposit to our Clockwork thread for it to run automations. According to [Clockwork Docs](https://docs.clockwork.xyz/developers/threads/fees), the automation base fee is **0.000001 SOL / executed instruction**.

In the lines below, we have our seeds defined, these seeds are being used multiple times in our program, so it's a better idea to define them in a constant.

Let's have a look into how we will initialize our bank account.
