# About

PDAs are a very powerful block of Solana. We're going to create a simple expense tracking app that allows us to add, update and remove expense entires. This tutorial is based on [Expense Tracker Workshop](https://github.com/GitBolt/expense-tracker-workshop). You can find full client side code there with table and chart as well.

# What you will learn

- Storing data in PDAs
