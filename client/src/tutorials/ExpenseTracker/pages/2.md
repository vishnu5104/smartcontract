# Initialize Expense Context

#### 2.1 Defining `InitializeExpense` context

Our first context is to initialize an expense context in order to create the instruction that will create our expense entry on-chain. Scroll to Line 49 and check this:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(id : u64)]
pub struct InitializeExpense<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub authority: Signer<'info>,

    #[account(
        init,
        payer = authority,
        space = 8 + 8 + 32+ (4 + 12)+ 8 + 1,
        seeds = [b"expense", authority.key().as_ref(), id.to_le_bytes().as_ref()],
        bump
    )]
    pub expense_account: Account<'info, ExpenseAccount>,

    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

In this context, we're first getting the `id` from our instruction params. This part:

```rs
#[instruction(id : u64)]
```

We're doing this to access the Id and pass it in one of the `seeds` of our `expense_account`.

In order to derive expense account PDAs, we need a unique value, and that unique value is this Id which will help us update and get a specific expense account.

### Accounts

- Authority: This account has access to add/modify/delete the expense account. It refers to the user's public key, as a user should have control over their expense account.
- Expense Account: This is the actual expense account that will store our expense data.

### Space Allocation

We are essentially using anchor [space reference](https://book.anchor-lang.com/anchor_references/space.html) to allocate the amount of bytes initializing each new expense will take.
The `+` sign is being used as a seperator to display space allocations of specific fields.

This is all we need to initialize an expense account, let's see how to update it next.
