# Defining Expense Struct

We will define what values an expense account will store. The space allocated is calculated accordingly. Check Line 100.

```rs
#[account]
#[derive(Default)]
pub struct ExpenseAccount {
    pub id: u64,
    pub owner: Pubkey,
    pub merchant_name: String,
    pub amount: u64,
}
```

Let's go through each of these one by one:

- id: We're first defining a unique ID for our expense entries. This ID will be used to modify a particular expense in the future.

- owner: The owner value will come in handy when we fetch expense entries in the frontend. We can use the `memcmp` filter in the `getProgramAccount` method to get expense accounts of a particular public key. We will learn about it around the end of this tutorial.

- merchant_name: This is the merchant name, stored as a string for our expenses.

- amount: This is simply the amount we spent.

This is the _only_ account we need to define in our program. Let's head over to the specific contexts which will be used in our instruction next.
