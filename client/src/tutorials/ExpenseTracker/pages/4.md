# Close Expense Context

Head over to line 83 and see this:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(id : u64)]
pub struct DeleteExpense<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub authority: Signer<'info>,

    #[account(
        mut,
        close = authority,
        seeds = [b"expense", authority.key().as_ref(), id.to_le_bytes().as_ref()],
        bump
    )]
    pub expense_account: Account<'info, ExpenseAccount>,

    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

Since we need to delete the expense entry, we outright close the account which in turn removes all the data stored in it. We also make sure by using `pub authority: Signer<'info>,` that the address deleting the expense account is also signer.

It is not clear from first sight that which part exactly is responsible for deleting this. Well, have a look at this part:

```rs
#[account(
    mut,
    close = authority,
    seeds = [b"expense", authority.key().as_ref(), id.to_le_bytes().as_ref()],
    bump
)]
```

Notice the `close = authority` part? Yes, that is responsible for closing our account.

That is pretty much it with what we need! We don't have any complex logic in instruction functions themselves. They are pretty straight forward. The main information is in the contexts.

Let's see how we can do some data fetching in frontend now, like I promised in the beginning!
