# Rewarding players with SOL! üìù

Hey!

Please follow the instruction for the setup in the [Tiny Adventure](/tutorials/tiny-adventure) tutorial for the basics if you have not yet.

In this tutorial we will learn how we can deposit SOL in a chest and reward it to a player.

For that we will use a second PDA called chest vault.

In later tutorials I will show you how to connect to this program from within Unity game engine.
