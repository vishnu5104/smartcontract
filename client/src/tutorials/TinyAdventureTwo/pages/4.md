Where to go from here?

Being able to give rewards to players gives all kind of possibilities.
You could for example organize a race, or an adventure game where people need to put in certain numbers to solve riddles (text adventure). Or you could add some chances and make a gambling game or add a second dimension to the level and add more movement options and spawn multiple chests.
You could also add a transaction fee for moving which fills up the chests.
Looking forward to see what you are building!
