# Respawn Instruction

The `respawn` instruction is used initialize the `enemy_boss` account if it does not already exist and reset the account to maximum health, essentially "respawning" the boss for another round of battle in the game. This instruction is used to either to initialize the account for the first time or when the boss's health has been reduced to 0, and a player wants to attack the boss again.

The constant `MAX_HEALTH` represents the starting health value:

```rust
const MAX_HEALTH: u64 = 1000;
```

The `EnemyBoss` struct defines the structure of the on-chain account that keeps track of the enemy boss's data, in this case, just the health:

```rust
#[account]
pub struct EnemyBoss {
    pub health: u64,
}
```

The `respawn` instruction requires the following accounts:

- `player` - The account of the player that signs the transaction.
- `enemy_boss` - The account which stores enemy boss's current health. This account is created if it doesn't exist already.
- `system_program` - A required account when creating a new account.

The `enemy_boss` account is initialized using a Program Derived Address (PDA) with only the string “boss” as a seed. The program is set up to create only a single `EnemyBoss` account, allowing all players to “attack” the same enemy.

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Respawn<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub player: Signer<'info>,
    #[account(
        init_if_needed,
        payer = player,
        space = 8 + 8,
        seeds = [b"boss"],
        bump,
    )]
    pub enemy_boss: Account<'info, EnemyBoss>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

The `respawn` instruction then sets the health of the `enemy_boss` account to `MAX_HEALTH`.

```rust
pub fn respawn(ctx: Context<Respawn>) -> Result<()> {
    // Reset enemy boss to max health
    ctx.accounts.enemy_boss.health = MAX_HEALTH;
    Ok(())
}
```
