# Solana Playground

Commands and snippets to help Solana development.

> üí°Ô∏è Rust/Solana toolchain is not necessary for the extension to work.

## Commands

Commands are accessed via the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows and Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS). You can type **solpg** to see all commands.

> ‚ö† Commands usually require VSCode to be in a program workspace to work properly. If you don't have a program, use one of the **Create** commands.
